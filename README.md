# The *Optimist*: Towards Fully Automated Graph Theory Research

This repository contains the code, data, and results for the paper "The *Optimist*: Towards Fully Automated Graph Theory Research".

## Overview

The *Optimist* is a Python agent for conjecturing in graph theory. Building on the work of *TxGraffiti*, the *Optimist* agent allows for real-time interaction with the mathematical conjecturing process. This repository houses the Colab/Jupyter notebooks used in the experiments with the *Optimist* in the manuscript "The *Optimist*: Towards Fully Automated Graph Theory Research".

## Repository Structure

- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for running the *Optimist* experiment.
